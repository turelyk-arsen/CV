          I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a diverse background in
          chemistry and leadership experience. Recently completing a Full Stack
          Developer course at Cap4 Lab organized by ADEM, I have undergone
          intensive training in both front-end and back-end web development to
          enhance my skills. Now based in Luxembourg, I am committed to
          expanding my skillset and have reached a B1 level in English. I am
          eager to join a dynamic team where I can leverage my technical and
          leadership skills to contribute as a valuable member.
          <!-- As a junior full-stack developer, I recently completed a Full Stack
          Developer course and have a strong background in chemistry. Despite
          not having a corresponding specialty, I started my career at a
          pharmaceutical plant and quickly climbed the ranks to become the head
          of a department, a position I held for 10 years. Now based in
          Luxembourg, I am committed to improving my English language skills and
          have reached a B1 level. I am eager to continue expanding my skillset
          and contribute my expertise to your team as a valuable member. -->

          <!-- I am a junior full-stack developer who recently graduated from a Full
          Stack Developer course. Although my education is in chemistry, after
          graduating from university, I started my career at a pharmaceutical
          plant as the youngest employee in one of the departments because my
          specialty did not correspond to the position. However, within 2 years,
          I became the head of this department and managed it for 10 years until
          I moved to Luxembourg more than a year ago. While here, I am improving
          my English language skills and have already reached a B1 level. I will
          continue to improve my skills to become a valuable member of your
          team. -->

          <!-- I am a talented junior full stack developer who recently relocated
          from Ukraine to Luxembourg. While here, I am working on improving my
          English language skills and have already passed B1 level exams. I am
          deeply passionate about developing and implementing user-friendly web
          applications. With my expertise in web development technologies and
          frameworks, I am confident in my ability to create cohesive,
          high-quality products. I am excited to bring my technical skills and
          knowledge to new challenges and projects. Furthermore, I am committed
          to continuously improving my skills to become a valuable member of any
